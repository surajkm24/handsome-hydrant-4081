            It’s been a decade since we started TrackingTime and a lot has
            changed since then. Looking ahead to the next ten years, we decided
            to revamp our brand to keep up with our product roadmap and
            evolution. We know where we want to be, and we want our brand to
            reflect that. The result is a brand new image to match our vision
            for the future of TrackingTime.

          <p>
            Focusing mainly on product development over the last few years, we
            wanted to shake things up and rebrand TrackingTime to better
            communicate who we are and where we’re going. Our passion for design
            made this the perfect opportunity to flex our creative muscles. So
            we got to work and created a new logo and updated our color scheme.
            Even though we wanted the core of our brand to remain recognizable,
            we feel this fresh, renovated look better reflects our path and
            goals for the future.

            This year we released two important new custom views: Project
            timeline and Company-wide Timeline, to enable you to track all your
            ongoing projects, and their progress, and see how they relate to one
            another. And we aim to add new features to these views over the
            first months of 2023. Additionally, we’ll create new views to help
            companies visualize their projects and collaborate seamlessly
            online. In the meantime, here’s what you can already do with both
            timelines:

        <div className="detail-para2">
          <p>
            This view provides an overview of all key elements of any project,
            allowing you and your team to manage everything together. As a
            result, you can see what everyone in your team is working on, which
            can improve planning and communication.

            This project-level timeline allows you to organize all your
            projects, and visualize how each one connects to the rest. It might
            be helpful for you and your team to plan out work and projects,

        <div className="detail-para2">
          <p>
            After collecting much feedback on invoicing, we have reached the
            third iteration, which supports more countries and use cases. And
            following our roadmap, we have planned a lot of enhancements for
            2023 to make our invoices as reliable as possible. Furthermore, we
            strive to improve project and user budgeting. We call it the Money
            Mode. We just released a new feature that allows you to create
            different time periods for your team. Money mode is based on this,
            which we believe is the core of the feature. By early 2023, we will
            be launching a complete budgeting feature with a wide range of
            budgeting styles for our clients to keep track of their budgets. As
            we wait for these amazing updates, take a look at the current state
            of these invoicing and some more details of what money mode will
            bring next:

        </div>

        <div className="detail-para2">
          <p>
            Using this feature streamlines your invoicing process. Through this
            improved version, you can visualize and record every step of the
            process, from draft to open and paid.
          </p>

        <div className="detail-heading2">
          <h4>Money Mode</h4>
        </div>

        <div className="detail-para2">
          <p>
            As we mentioned before, an improved version of this add-on is
            arriving in 2023. This will enable you to set up billable projects
            and tasks, and establish validity periods for each team member’s
            price and cost. As a result, it will become an integral part of
            project budgeting, giving you the option to keep track of all your
            budgets in the way that suits you best.

        </div>

        <div className="detail-para2">
          <p>
            We redesigned our desktop and mobile apps. And soon we will be
            adding a new app to the family, called Autotrack. As you can
            imagine, Autotrack will keep a record of all the applications that
            are used on your computer at a set time. But don’t worry: Autotrack
            is designed with privacy at its core. No information will leave your
            computer. This data will only be accessible to you and is only meant
            to function as a reminder of what you did in the past days.
            Meanwhile, check out what’s new with the rest of our apps:

        <div className="detail-heading2">
          <h4>Mobile App</h4>
        </div>

        <div className="detail-para2">
          <p>
            We repositioned the menu and moved the hour bar up to improve
            navigation through the different days by enabling a left-right
            swipe. We also enhanced the form creation for time entries. A new
            task design also provides better visibility for descriptions,
            history records, comments, and hours. You can now organize all your
            tasks, visualize which are complete, and add task lists right from
            the app. Further, we redesigned the player, so you can just hit play
            and start tracking an empty task. Then you can click the list icon
            next to the player to select which task to track. Smooth, huh?

          <h4>Desktop App</h4>
        </div>

        <div className="detail-para2">
          <p>
            On the other hand, the improved desktop app lets you manage projects
            and tasks. And, with the enhanced player, you can easily start and
            stop tracking.

          <p>
            The Safari extension was also released this year. Now you can move
            across browsers and use the Tracking Button enabled in all of them.
            Additionally, we released new integrations with Figma, Coda,
            ClickUp, and many more.

          <p>
            This is an entirely new area of our product that was released a few
            weeks ago. While using TrackingTime to record working hours, we
            understand that having a time-off management tool inside the app is
            a must. This first integration brings holidays, time-off requests
            and approval, and the third version of Time Cards.

            We redesigned our brand to reflect how we evolved since we started
